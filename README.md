# Hytale Mod / Plugin Template

Just move your ``HytaleServer.jar`` into the `libs/` directory of the project.

There's also a ``HERE_GOES_YOUR_HYTALE_SERVER_JAR`` file, you can't miss it.

## Replacing

Everything you should replace is prefixed with ``REPLACE_WITH_``.

Just search all files for that. Mostly only these ones:
- ``build.gradle.kts``
- ``manifest.json``
